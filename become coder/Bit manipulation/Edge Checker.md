Constraints

1â‰¤a

a and b are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

a b


Output

If the points numbered a and b are directly connected by a line segment, print Yes; otherwise, print No.
The judge is case-sensitive: be sure to print uppercase and lowercase letters correctly.

Sample Input 1

4 5

Sample Output 1

Yes

Explanation:

In the figure shown in the Problem Statement, the points numbered 4 and 5 are directly connected by a line segment.
Thus, Yes should be printed.

Sample Input 2 

3 5

Sample Output 2

No

Explanation:

In the figure shown in the Problem Statement, the points numbered 33 and 55 are not directly connected by a line segment.
Thus, No should be printed.

Sample Input 3

1 10

Sample Output 3

Yes

```python
 a, b = map(int,input().split())
if abs(a - b) == 1 or (a == 10 and b == 1) or (a == 1 and b == 10):
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
